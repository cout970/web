    <h3>Notebook</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/cout970/Elm-interpreter">Web repo</a>
    <p>
        This app is inspired by Jupyter Notebook, it allows to write an run snippets of code.
        Right now there are no data visualization features and only Javascript is supported.
        In the future <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> will be available
        using WebAssembly, thanks to <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/">wasm-pack</a>
        an <a href="https://github.com/cout970/Elm-interpreter">interpreter</a> can be embedded into
        the page to run Elm code on the fly. Also in the future a rendering library based on WebGL
        will be added to allow the creation of charts and 3D data visualizations.

    <h3>Kotlin libraries</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/cout970/Libraries">Github repo</a>
    <p>
        A set of useful libraries for 3D applications and OpenGL.
        Contains the following libraries:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>CollisionLib: Collision detection for 2D and 3D shapes</li>
        <li>GlUtilities: Boilerplate code to deal with OpenGL</li>
        <li>MatrixLib: Implements mutable and immutable matrices of 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4</li>
        <li>VectorLib: Implements mutable and immutable vectors of 2, 3 and 4 elements and quaternions</li>
        <li>OblLib: Simple Obj format loader</li>
        <li>RaytraceLib: Raytrace of simple 3D geometries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Right now the libraries are being ported to Kotlin Multiplatform to run in Native,
        JVM and JS with minimal changes. The first library ported is <a href="https://github.com/cout970/MultiplatformVectorLib">VectorLib</a>

    <h3>3D Modeler</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/cout970/Modeler">Github repo</a>
    <p>
        An application to create and edit 3D models, supports obj, glTF and several
        minecraft-especific formats. Its primary goal was to replace an old tool called Techne
        that allowed to create minecraft models using cubes and planes. This tools has the same
        functionalities but adds a bunch more like 3D animation, use of any kind of shape, custom
        UV mapping and more.

    <h3>Graveyard</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/cout970/Graveyard">Github repo</a>
    <p>
        A mod for <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/">Vintage Story</a> that places a tombstone when you die, the tombstone will keep your
        items so they don't disappear and you can right click the block to get your items back.

    <h3>Raytrace-rs</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/cout970/raytrace-rs">Github repo</a>
    <p>
        A simple 3D raytracer made in Rust based on the book Raytracing in one weekend by Peter Shirley.

    <h3>Reactive</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/cout970/Reactive">Github repo</a>
    <p>
        A copy of React-JS made on top of <a href="https://github.com/SpinyOwl/legui">Legui</a> (a.k.a. SpinyOwl), allows to make user interfaces in Kotlin in the
        same way react does. You make a render function that transforms the state of you application into an tree
        of components called virtual DOM, the library compares the current tree of components and the new tree of components
        and only updates the components that are different keeping the rest intact.

    <h3>Modjam 5</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/cout970/Modjam5">Github repo</a>
    <p>
        My entry to the Modjam 5 competition. You have 3 days to make a mod from scratch and the community
        votes for the best. My entry end up in the 4th position. The mod adds a big trebuchet to the game that
        can throw TNT or mobs to large distances.
